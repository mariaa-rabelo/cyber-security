- Checkpoint: 29 April-3 May

- Final presentations and demonstrations: 27-28 May

Classify examples in terms of the concept under analysis. 

Exploratory data analysis: class distribution, values per attribute, etc.

Different learning algorithms should be employed and compared using appropriate evaluation metrics (performance during learning, confusion matrix, precision, recall, accuracy, F1 measure) and the time spent to train/test the models.

Supervised learning includes the following steps: 
- dataset analysis to check for the need for data pre-processing,
- identification of the target concept,
- definition of the training and test sets,
- selection and parameterization of the learning algorithms to employ
- evaluation of the learning process (in particular on the test set).

At least 3 supervised learning (classification) algorithms should be employed (Decision Trees, Neural Networks, K-NN, SVM, â€¦), but more may be employed and compared using the Scikit-Learn Python library and considering the characteristics of the dataset. 

Results should be compared using tables or plots (e.g., using Seaborn or Matplotlib libraries).
